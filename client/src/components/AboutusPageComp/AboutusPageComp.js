          JNEC is one of the constituent colleges of the Royal University of
          Bhutan (RUB) located in Dewathang. The College started with the
          infrastructure development in 1974 coinciding with the 3rd Five Year
          Development Plan of the country and offering Diploma programmes in
          Civil, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering. The College currently
          offers ten academic programmes; seven Diploma and three Bachelor of
          Engineering. The College continues to explore, plan and offer academic
          programmes based on the socio‐economic needs of the country. As a
          premier college, several works are also being carried out to support
          community development. The college has been accredited by the Bhutan
          Accreditation Council and has been awarded Grade – A.

          University of Innsbruck has in totals 28000 students and 16 faculties.
          The Institute for Structural Engineering and Material Sciences belongs
          to the faculty of Engineering Sciences. It consists of 6 Units of
          which the Units Energy Efficient Buildings and Timber Engineering are
          taking part in the project. The Unit of Energy Efficient Buildings
          (EEB) with combines two directions. Building physics deals on the one
          hand with thermal and moisture transport as well as acoustics of
          building construction, natural and artificial lighting. Additionally,
          the topics of HVAC (Heating, Ventilation & Air Conditioning) systems,
          renewable energy integration (solar, biomass, heat pumps), efficient
          energy systems for buildings and city quarters as well as spatial
          energy planning are covered. The core competence of the Unit of Timber
          Engineering is practice‐oriented research in the field of timber
          engineering. The researchers at the Unit of Timber Engineering are
          trained and experienced structural engineers or architects, conducting
          basic and applied research on wood as a building material, new wood
          products and state‐of‐the‐art fastener technology. The Unit of Timber
          Engineering has excellent possibilities to produce high‐quality
          specimens for experimental research with state‐of‐the‐art CNC
          technology. It also has access to testing facilities to realize
          experiments for multiple scales of basic and applied timber
          engineering research. An additional research focus is sound and fire
          protection. The Department of Subject‐Specific Education unites the
          subject‐specific education of future teachers. The section Science,
          Geography, Computer Science, and Mathematics Education will be
          involved in this project for the STEM education training. UIBK was
          active in the following projects in North‐South cooperation: HEBA:
          High level rEnewabBle and energy efficiency mAster courses;
          EGREEN–Development of Environmental Engineering and injection of
          climate change concept for Undergraduate curriculum :EU experience for
          Jordan & Syria; CIMCEB: Curricula Development of Interdisciplinary
          Master Courses in Energy Efficient Building Design in Nepal & Bhutan;
          Master programmes on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in
          Buildings in Central Asia & Russia; Development and implementation of
          a Master Course "Energy Management" in three Libyan Universities;
          MAPEC Curriculum development for Master Program of Environmental
          engineering and Climate change; Sustainable comfort through building
          optimization and solar cooling in India.
